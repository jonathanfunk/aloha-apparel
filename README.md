Aloha Apparel
======

## Project
This website is for a Hawaiian themed clothing store. The objective for this project is to work with provided assets/design instructions to build a responsive single page website.

## Technology
* Atom Text Editor
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Command Line Interface
* Git/Github

## Learning Experience
I'm no stranger when it comes to html and css but I've learned some tricks and practices which I feel are very valuable. This project came with challenges but it always feel good to solve the problem. My favorite part about this project is learning how to use the mobile-first approach. This is a method I would like to adapt to my future projects. Command Line Interface and Git/Github are very new to me but I was able to learn quickly.
